        <Description>
You have been taught to sense the presence of the Taint
through your connection to the kami. Any time you target
someone with a spell (including a benign or helpful spell)
you may expend an additional spell slot (in any Element)
and take a Free Action to make a Contested Willpower roll
with the target. If you succeed in the roll, you can sense
whether or not the target is Tainted (e.g. has at least one
full Rank of Taint).
Normally this technique can only be triggered with targeted
spells that have an instantaneous effect. However, if
you are trained in the Yogo Shugenja School you may also
use this technique with your wards, activating it when the
ward is placed. If the spell has a duration, you may only
use the technique at the moment you place the ward.

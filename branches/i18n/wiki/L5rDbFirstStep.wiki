#summary Open the database using the suggested tool.

= Let's start =

You've downloaded and installed SQLite Expert Personal right?
The first thing to do is to locate the L5RCM database:

----
browse to the installation directory either under

*Program Files\OpenNingia\L5RCM*
or 
*Program Files (x86)\OpenNingia\L5RCM*

continue under share/l5rcm subdirectories and grab `l5rdb.sqlite`; *DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY*, make a copy on a directory of your choice ( e.g. c:\MyL5rDb\ )

----
Finally launch SQLite Expert Personal and click on the `Open Button`

Then select the file you just copied ( e.g. c:\MyL5rDb\l5rdb.sqlite ). You'll obtain something like this:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/954487/l5rcm_db_guide/sqliteprof_2.png

= Almost there = 

Now you must decide which content you want to edit, depending on your choice we're going to work on different Database Tables.
For database beginners I'd recommend starting with AddingNewClan.

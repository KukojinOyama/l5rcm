#summary A database guide to L5RCM
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

= Introduction =

One of the most requested feature is to add custom data; and yes I'm working on it, but it will not be available 'easily' anytime soon.\
To do that I'll need to totally rewrite my data handling procedures and storage, a time-consuming task.


= The good news =

The database backend used for L5RCM is quite standard, it is called SQLite
and there are *plenty* of tools out there to edit its contents.

If you're on windows I'd recommend SQLite Expert Personal that you can download from here:
http://www.sqliteexpert.com/download.html

= The bad news =

Of course editing a database is not something anyone can do, it is difficult to add/modify/remove data without breaking some complex constraint.

= This guide =

Finally the reason I created this page is to guide you on this task, so you can succeed.

= Final warnings =

ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR EXISTING DATABASE BEFORE.
KEEP IN MIND THAT EDITING DATA CAN INVALIDATE YOUR OLD CHARACTER SAVES.
DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

If you're ready

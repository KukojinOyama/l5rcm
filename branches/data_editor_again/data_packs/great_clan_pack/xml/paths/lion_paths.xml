        <Description>
The Akodo Kensai navigates the battlefield with his katana
in his hands. He remains untouched by the enemies
around him, for he can direct the flow of combat with
his own attacks. While using a sword and in the Attack
Stance, you may increase your Armor TN by your Honor
Rank against the first melee attack each Combat Round.
Additionally, once per skirmish you may activate a Kata
as a Free Action.

The Lion Paragon lives by the tenets of Bushido, and the
strength of his devotion allows him to push himself beyond
his physical limits. You may make melee attacks as
a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action. However, if
you choose to do so, you may only make one attack that
Turn. (This prohibits you from making any additional attacks,
even with the Extra Attack Maneuver.)
Once per skirmish, you may spend a Void Point as a
Free Action to activate this Technique. Your Honor Rank
is considered to be double for the purpose of your other
School Techniques. (For example, if you are a Matsu
Bushi, you add double your Honor Rank to all damage
rolls from your Rank 1 Technique.) This effect may increase
your Honor Rank above 10, but does not stack with
any other effects that modify Technique bonuses; in such a
case, choose the highest modifi er. The effects of this Technique
end when the encounter ends.

As masters of necromancy, the Chuda often find themselves
in need of corpses for their spells and techniques.
This ritual is designed to ensure such corpses are always
available, regardless of circumstances. It normally requires
one hour to complete, although it can be shortened (with
Raises) to a minimum of ten minutes. You may target a
maximum number of corpses equal to your Taint Rank. At
the spell’s conclusion the targeted corpses are prepared for
use. At any later time within the spell’s duration you may
take a Complex Action and expend an Earth spell slot to
instantly summon the prepared corpses to your location.
Chuda Necromancers are particularly fond of using this
spell to summon forth corpses for use with their insidious
Technique.

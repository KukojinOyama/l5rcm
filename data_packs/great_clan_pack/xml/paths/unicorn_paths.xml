The Ide Trader is a master of the merchant class, extending
his control across the land. You cannot lose Honor or
Glory for using the Commerce skill in public. You may
attempt to persuade someone to become a new mercantile
partner for your clan by rolling Courtier (Manipulation) /
Awareness with a bonus to the roll equal to double your
Commerce Skill Rank. For persuading a commoner the
suggested TN is 25, increased by the GM as appropriate if
the target is hostile. Persuading a samurai requires a Contested
Roll against the target’s Etiquette (Courtesy) / Willpower,
with the target gaining a bonus equal to double
his Commerce Skill Rank. (Some samurai targets may gain
additional bonuses or even be immune to this Technique
due to unshakable loyalties—the GM has fi nal say in such
matters.)
If you succeed in the roll, the target agrees to become a
part of your network of connections and commercial assets.
You may immediately gain the target as a free Ally
with 1 point of Devotion.
If you are using the optional Way of the Daimyo rules
found in the L5R RPG 4th Edition supplement Emerald
Empire, taking this Path earns you a Duty Point.

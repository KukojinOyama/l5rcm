      <Tech name="The Sword And The Soul" rank="1" id="dragon_the_sword_and_the_soul"><Description>
The Master Sensei has learned that the sword can bring
moments of perfect harmony, just like art or meditation.
When fi ghting with a sword, any time you reduce an opponent
to Down, Out, or Dead, you regain 1 Void Point.
This can temporarily increase your total Void Points above
your Void Ring, although any such “extra” points disappear
at the end of the current skirmish.
      </Description></Tech>
      <Tech name="The Body Is Illusion" rank="2" id="dragon_the_body_is_illusion"><Description>
The Master Sensei has studied meditation and enlightenment
to such an extent that he can transcend the limitations
of the flesh. You may take a Simple Action to spend
a Void Point to ignore Wound Penalties (including Down,
but not Out) for the remainder of this skirmish, or for ten
minutes when outside of a skirmish.
      </Description></Tech>
      <Tech name="Sword Of The Sensei" rank="3" id="dragon_sword_of_the_sensei"><Description>
The Master Sensei knows that a true teacher can share his
greatest power with his students. Once per day, you may
take a Simple Action to roll Awareness/Meditation at a TN
of 25 plus 5 for each ally fi ghting alongside you. If you
succeed, your allies gain the benefi ts of your Rank One
technique for the remainder of this skirmish.
